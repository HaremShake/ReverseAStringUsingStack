Reverse a string using Stack in C#

Stack serves as a collection of elements. There are two main operations of Stack.

**Push** - Adds elements to the collection.

**Pop** - Removes elements from the collection.

Stack works in a LIFO (Last in, First Out) manner. It is considered a linear data structure. The push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure.
